A [first order theory] is [a theory built on a formal logical system with quantification over non-logical objects and variables].
* Formalization                                                       :drill:
In a first order formalization of category theory, we can formalize universal properties by [specifying ϕ as a first-order formula in the relevant logic].

** Name
The Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov Interpretation (BHK interpretation)
** Constituents
+ A proof of P ∧ Q is a pair (a, b) if a is a proof of P and b is a proof of Q
+ A proof of P ∨ Q is a pair (a, b) where a is 0 and b is a proof of P, or a is 1 and b is a proof of Q
+ A proof of P → Q is a function that converts a proof of P into a proof of Q
+ A proof of ∃ x ∈ S : ϕ(x) is a pair (a, b) where a is an element of S and b is a proof of ϕ(a)
+ A proof of ∀ x ∈ S : ϕ(x) is a function that converts an element a of S into a proof of ϕ(a)
+ The formula ¬ P is defined as P → ⊥ and interpreted accordingly
+ There is no proof of ⊥

A [global element of an object C] is [an arrow from the terminal object to C].

Informally, a [tensor product/monoidal product] is [a binary operation on objects, typically denoted ⊗, that is associative and has an identity I, along with some coherence conditions].
* Technique                                                           :drill:
To define a concept in an abstract category, we can often start by [looking at the definition over sets, expressing it in terms of (commutative) compositional diagrams, and dropping the set specifics]
** Show it for categorical monoids.

[The microcosm principle] states that [to define certain structures internal to a category, the category must have a "categorified" version of that structure].
** Why is it called that?
"As above, so below"
** Give some examples
Need a monoidal category to define monoids, need a symmetric monoidal category to define commutative monoids.

To [internalize] some structure is to [transport the definition of that structure over sets/some other familiar category into one over an abstract category that itself has "enough structure"].

[The no-cloning theorem] can be interpreted as proving that [⊗ over Hilbert spaces is not a categorical product]
** How so?
If Δ : A ⊗ A is a natural transformation ("natural diagonal"), then ⊗ is a categorical product. Lack of this means there's no generic way to "copy" A for all A.
